<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Valeria and I am studyng to become a Web Developer.</p>

<p>I am from Italy but I live in Ireland for the past 6 years. I moved to this country because I wanted to improve my English, working as aupair. 
  After few years I found a job and thanks to it my actual partner. Now I am a mom of one amazing boy and my priorities have changed as my son comes first.</p>

<p>I prefer to work from home and have a flexible schedule as I can spend the rest of the time with him because they are small just once.
  In the free time I am an holistic therapist and meditation facilitor as I love helping people and see the smile on their faces.
